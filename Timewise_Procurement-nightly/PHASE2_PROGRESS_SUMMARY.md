## Conclusion

Significant progress has been made on Phase 2 of the KYNSEY MD Medical ERP system. The database schema has been expanded to support medical charts, billing, and enhanced patient demographics. The backend API has been developed to provide comprehensive functionality for patient charts and billing operations.

The next steps involve completing the reporting endpoints on the backend and developing the frontend components to provide a user-friendly interface for the new functionality. Once these tasks are completed, Phase 2 will be finalized, and the project will move on to Phase 3, which focuses on the Patient Portal and LLM Integration.

## How to Use Phase 2 Features

### Database Expansion

To apply the database schema changes, run:

```bash
./Timewise_Procurement-nightly/execute-phase2-expansion.sh
```

### Using the Chart API

The Chart API allows you to manage patient medical records:

```javascript
// Create a patient chart
const chart = await fetch('/api/medical/charts', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ patient_id: 123 })
});

// Add a chart note
const note = await fetch(`/api/medical/charts/${chartId}/notes`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    provider_id: 456,
    note_type: 'SOAP',
    subjective: 'Patient reports...',
    objective: 'Examination shows...',
    assessment: 'Diagnosis is...',
    plan: 'Treatment plan includes...'
  })
});
```

### Using the Billing API

The Billing API provides comprehensive medical billing functionality:

```javascript
// Create an insurance claim
const claim = await fetch('/api/medical/billing/claims', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    patient_id: 123,
    insurance_id: 789,
    date_of_service: '2025-05-08',
    total_amount: 150.00,
    status: 'Pending'
  })
});

// Add a payment
const payment = await fetch('/api/medical/billing/payments', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    patient_id: 123,
    payment_date: '2025-05-08',
    payment_method: 'Credit Card',
    payment_amount: 50.00
  })
});
