  - Added proper module resolution configuration for medical components
  - Implemented inline component placeholders to reduce dependency chains
  - Fixed MIME type errors by ensuring proper module bundling

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Enhanced overall compatibility across browsers:
  - Fixed file loading issues that were causing NS_ERROR_CORRUPTED_CONTENT errors
  - Improved MIME type handling for TypeScript files
  - Updated Vite server configuration to properly serve module files
  - Cleaned stale module cache to prevent loading errors
  - Added explicit file extension handling in the Vite resolver

These updates fix the medical charts functionality and ensure that the `/medical/charts` route loads correctly. Users can now search for patients and access their charts and vital signs through this interface, which properly integrates with the existing patient profile system.

## [2025-05-11] Medical Database and Charts Implementation

### Medical Database Schema Implementation
- ✅ Add the complete database schema implementation:
  - Created core tables for medical records:
    - patients (demographics, contact info, insurance)
    - charts (medical records, history, progress notes)
    - vital_signs (temperature, BP, pulse, etc.)
    - appointments (scheduling, status tracking)
    - medications (prescriptions, refills, history)
    - lab_results (test results, reference ranges)
    - clinical_notes (SOAP format, digital signatures)
    - documents (scanned records, consent forms)
  - Implemented foreign key relationships:
    - patient_id linking across all patient-related tables
    - provider_id for tracking responsible physicians
    - appointment_id linking to clinical notes and vitals
    - chart_id connecting related medical records
  - Added data integrity measures:
    - Cascading updates/deletes for referential integrity
    - Check constraints for valid data ranges
    - Unique constraints for patient identifiers
    - NOT NULL constraints for required fields
  - Created performance optimizations:
    - Indexed frequently queried columns
    - Optimized JOIN operations with proper keys
    - Created materialized views for complex queries
    - Implemented proper partitioning for large tables

### Medical Charts Integration
- ✅ Enhanced medical charts functionality:
  - Implemented secure chart access with role-based permissions
  - Added real-time chart updates with WebSocket support
  - Created comprehensive audit logging for all chart access
  - Implemented version control for chart modifications
  - Added digital signature support for chart entries
- ✅ Improved patient data handling:
  - Created efficient data retrieval with optimized queries
  - Implemented proper data archiving system
  - Added robust data validation for all inputs
  - Created comprehensive search functionality
  - Implemented proper data encryption at rest
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and stability:
  - Added automatic recovery for network failures
  - Implemented proper timeout handling
  - Created comprehensive error logging
  - Added retry mechanisms for failed operations
  - Implemented proper transaction management
- ✅ Improved frontend-backend integration:
  - Created TypeScript interfaces for all API responses
  - Implemented proper error state handling
  - Added loading states for all operations
  - Created optimistic updates for better UX
  - Implemented proper cache invalidation
  - Added real-time sync between multiple clients
