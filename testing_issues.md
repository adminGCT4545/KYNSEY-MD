- Technical Details: Missing dependency in useEffect for view mode persistence

**Issue 2: Status Filtering**
- Component: DailySchedulerView.tsx
- Description: Status filter doesn't update in real-time for active appointments
- Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Filter by "in-progress" status
  2. Change appointment status to "completed"
- Expected: Appointment should disappear from filtered view immediately
- Actual: Appointment remains visible until page refresh
- Technical Details: Missing status update in appointment state management

**Issue 3: Date Range Filtering**
- Component: DailySchedulerView.tsx
- Description: Date filtering not implemented in appointment filtering logic
- Steps to Reproduce:

**Issue 1: Color Style Conflicts**
- Component: StatusFilter.tsx
- Description: Dynamic color class generation may conflict with Tailwind's purge settings
- Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Toggle different status filters

- Actual: Some color variations might be missing in production build
- Technical Details: Dynamic template literals in class names (line 118) may not be preserved in production

**Issue 2: Icon Loading**
- Component: StatusFilter.tsx
- Description: Status icons may flash or appear undefined momentarily
- Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Rapidly toggle status filters
- Expected: Smooth icon transitions

- Actual: Possible UI lag during filtering operation
- Technical Details: Search effect (line 59) runs on every keystroke without debouncing

**Issue 3: State Management**
- Component: PatientManagementView.tsx
- Description: Selected patient state may become stale after search
- Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Select a patient
  2. Search for different patients
  3. Clear search
- Expected: Selected patient state should remain consistent
- Actual: Selected patient may become desynced with filtered list
- Technical Details: Missing dependency handling between selectedPatient and filteredPatients states

#### PatientSearchBar Component
**Issue 1: Search Input Validation**
- Component: PatientSearchBar.tsx
- Description: No input validation or sanitization for search queries
- Steps to Reproduce:
